# GreenSync AI

GreenSync AI is a sustainable and intelligent energy management system designed to optimize energy consumption in data centers. It uses artificial intelligence to balance computing loads and integrates renewable energy sources for maximum efficiency.

## 🌍 Project Overview

As AI technologies expand, the demand for energy in data centers continues to grow, increasing carbon emissions and operational costs. GreenSync AI tackles this issue with a sustainable and tech-driven solution.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **AI Load Forecasting:** Dynamically distributes server load based on efficiency.
- **Solar-Powered System:** Solar panels provide energy during daylight.
- **Outside-Air Cooling:** Cools servers using ambient outdoor air instead of traditional AC systems.

## 💡 Benefits

- **Environmental:** Reduced carbon footprint and energy waste.
- **Technical:** Real-time optimization and smarter load balancing.
- **Economic:** Lower energy costs for companies like Microsoft.

## 📈 Projected Impact

If implemented at scale across Microsoft’s data centers, GreenSync AI could reduce energy consumption by up to 30%, helping the company move closer to its sustainability goals.
